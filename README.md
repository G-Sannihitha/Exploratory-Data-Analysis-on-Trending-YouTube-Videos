# Exploratory Data Analysis on Trending YouTube Videos

The project focuses on **exploratory data analysis (EDA), clustering, and sentiment-based trend analysis** on YouTube video data. The goal of this research is to explore the patterns affecting the success of videos through exploratory data analysis (EDA) of popular videos on YouTube to explore trends in genres, timing, audience engagement including likes, views, comments, etc. With this project it is our intention to
help content creators and marketers develop strategies that allow them to reach more viewers on YouTube while exploring trends in timing of posts, genres, and audience engagement. In addition, this study will explore the relationship between video length, title lengths, and tags and how these metrics along with YouTube's ranking algorithm affect performance. This type of thorough research
would provide valuable information for marketers and content creators who would like to improve their presence on YouTube.
